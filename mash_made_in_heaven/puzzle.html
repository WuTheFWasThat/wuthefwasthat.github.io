  Instructions
</h2>

<ul>
      <li>
Take some _____ and make it come true.  Whip for 13 seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
Add some granular _____ from an estuary.  Mix for 14 seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
Add turmeric and _____, sticking around for 13 seconds until you can smell the aromatics.
      </li>
      <li>
Chop some fresh _____ for 6 seconds, then toss into the mix to spice it up.
      </li>
      <li>
Squeeze some  _____ and let it sit for 8 minutes to make it good as hell.
      </li>
      <li>
Mince some  _____ to impress your Scottish friends.  Cook in a pan on medium-low for 23 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
Now coat the pan in _____ as if you were deep frying.  Brown for 10 minutes before adding the rest of the mixture.  Let simmer.
      </li>
      <li>
Time for the stars of the dish - _____!  Boil in a big pot for 3 hours, and then drain.
      </li>
      <li>
Pour half of the pan mixture into the pot and set the rest aside. Add a French or English _____ to the ensemble, and cook on low for another 6 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
Your pot will start smelling good at the drop of a _____, just give it 2 minutes to steam away.
      </li>
      <li>
Take some _____ and praise them to make them larger.  Whisk into the pot for 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
Your _____ will make you happy for years to come.  Caramelize on high in a second pan; this should take no time.
      </li>
      <li>
Pour some _____ straight from the worm into this pan.  Simmer on low for about 9 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
A splash of _____ will make things aromatic (no oak, please).  You can keep the cone for when you’re yearning over this dish later.  Reduce another 8 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
Combine everything from both pans into the pot and stir for 2 minutes.  Now for a secret ingredient!  Slip in a _____ if you want everyone to know how to make this delicious dish.
      </li>
      <li>
Add the _____ for some richness. Good lord, don't be stingy here! Spend 2 minutes spreading evenly.
      </li>
      <li>
Best for last - top it off with a special _____! Finding one that speaks to your soul could take 16 years or more, but it's worth it for this dish to truly come together.
      </li>
