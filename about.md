A brief history of me:
- I currently work as a software engineer at Google, working on deep learning for user personalization.
- Before that, I was one of the first engineers at a startup called Terminal.com that provided Linux instances in the browser, which was acquired by Udacity.
- Before that, I did my undergrad in math and CS at MIT, and then stayed for a Master's working on probabilistic programming languages.
- And before that, I was a random kid in San Diego.

In my spare time, I like to:
- Work on [side projects](/projects)
- Think about random topics (especially computer science and technology).  You can get a sample from [my blog](/blog)
- Spend time with my girlfriend and other friends
- Play games, read, listen to music, etc.  [Here is a sample of things I've found most entertaining](/favorites)
