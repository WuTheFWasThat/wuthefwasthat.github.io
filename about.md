I currently work as a software engineer at Google, working on deep learning for user personalization.
Before that, I was one of the first engineers at a startup called Terminal.com, which was acquired by Udacity.
Before that, I studied math and CS at MIT, where I did my undergrad and a Master's working on probabilistic programming languages.
And before that, I was a random kid in San Diego.

I'm generally concerned about existential risk.  I enjoy thinking about many research topics, and about technology.
I also enjoy playing many games, such as Super Smash Brothers Melee, DDR, Dominion, Hanabi, and lots of puzzle games.
