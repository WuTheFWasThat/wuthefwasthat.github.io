# About

I'm a research/software engineer in the Bay Area wishing to do good.
I'm interested in the long term future of the world, and am afraid of advanced technology causing bad outcomes.
I currently think most about artificial intelligence, which seems likely to be transformative in my lifetime.

In my free time, I like to:
- Appreciate things humanity has produced, e.g. reading, playing games, doing puzzles, watching shows, listening to music, learning about past discoveries.
  Here are some of [my favorite things](/favorites).
- Spend time with my family and friends.
- Work on a variety of [side projects](/projects).
- Think and occasionally [write up thoughts](/blog).
  I'd like to say I think about all kinds of worldly and mathematical topics, but it's largely just computer science and technology.

I currently live in Oakland with my wonderful wife. I've been lucky to have had a very priviliged and enjoyable life.
