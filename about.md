# About

I'm a research/software engineer based in Oakland and wishing to do good.
I'm interested in the long term future of the world, and am afraid of risks from advanced technology.
I currently think most about artificial intelligence, which seems likely to be transformative in my lifetime.

In my free time, I like to:
- Appreciate things humans have produced, e.g. playing games, doing puzzles, reading, watching shows, listening to music, learning about past discoveries.
  Here are some of [my favorite things](/favorites).
- Spend time with my family and friends.
- Work on a variety of [side projects](/projects).
- Think and very occasionally [write up thoughts](/blog). I wish I could say I thought about all manner of worldly topics, but it's really just computer science and technology.
