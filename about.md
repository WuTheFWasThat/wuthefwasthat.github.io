Hi!  I'm a software engineer who enjoys thinking about all kinds of mathematical and worldly topics,
and aspires to make interesting and useful things.
This blog is to share a slice of me, mainly through my thoughts and my creations.

I'm quite interested in the long term future of the world, and am (perhaps irrationally) afraid of artificial intelligence and biotech causing human extinction.
In my personal life, I try to be reasonable and to not be a jerk, with limited success.

I've been lucky to have a very enjoyable life. A brief history of me:
- I was born in San Diego, where I grew up (except a stint in the Bay Area years 1 to 8).
  I spent much of my time on games and the internet.  My main accomplishment in life was getting into college.
- I then spent 4.5 years at MIT, where I had a blast, learned a lot, and met amazing people.
  I double majored in math and CS, and did a Master's working on probabilistic programming languages.
- Armed with theory knowledge, I moved to San Francisco to be the 2nd employee at Terminal.com, a startup providing computer environments in the browser, where I spent almost 4 years.
  The company was later acquired by Udacity.
- I'm now at Google, working on deep learning for user personalization.

In my spare time, I:
- Spend time with my girlfriend, family, and friends.
- Work on [side projects](/projects).
- Read, play games and do puzzles, listen to and play music, etc.  [Here is a sample of things I've found most entertaining](/favorites).
- Think about random topics (especially computer science and technology).  You can get a sample from [my blog](/blog).
