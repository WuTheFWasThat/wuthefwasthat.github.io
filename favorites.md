Here are some lists of my favorite things.
Individual lists are very roughly ordered by how much I like them.

If you have recommendations based on these lists, please let me know!
Also, hope you find some new gems!

## Games

I primarily play [puzzle games](puzzle_games.md).
I also enjoy many board and card games, most notably deck-building games (check out [Engine](https://www.engine-game.com), a game my friend made).
As per MIT tradition, I occasionally do puzzle hunts, though I'm not that great at them.
I play some DDR as well, mainly because it doubles as exercise.
I also try to stay away from Super Smash Brothers (Melee and Ultimate) due to its addictive properties.
