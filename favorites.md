I enjoy thinking about computer science and technology.
I'm generally concerned about existential risk.
I also enjoy playing many games, such as Super Smash Brothers Melee, DDR, board games (e.g. Dominion, Hanabi), and puzzle games (e.g. Blocks with Letters On, Braid, Jelly No Puzzle, Stephen's Sausage Roll).
